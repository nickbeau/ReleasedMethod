# Release Management

**Release Management** is a critical pillar of the Released Method. It ensures every software release is reliable, production-ready, and aligned with quality expectations — without dragging delivery timelines or relying on luck. This pillar covers five core areas:

- **Quality Bar**
- **Automated Release Process**
- **Staging and Production Environments**
- **Release Authorization**
- **Version Control**

## Quality Bar

The **Quality Bar** defines what “ready to release” actually means. It provides a clear, objective threshold for when software is stable enough to ship — balancing quality with time-to-market.

Your bar should be high, but realistic. Typical criteria include:

- Remaining open tasks
- Open bug count and severity
- Percentage of features tested
- Percentage of features documented

Each feature/task progresses through tracked phases to ensure nothing is missed.

### Task Lifecycle

- **New** – Proposed and awaiting triage or assignment
- **In Development** – Actively being built; iterated until code complete
- **In Test** – Undergoes validation, regression, and coverage checks (see [Testing & QA](testing-qa.md))
- **In Documentation** – Features documented and docs tested for clarity and completeness
- **Closed** – Task fully delivered; ongoing bug fixes tracked separately

### Quality Bar Metrics

- ✅ **All tasks closed** – No active development pending
- 🐞 **No open Sev 1 / Pri 1 bugs** – Showstoppers are resolved or blocked
- 🚩 **Punting** – Deliberate deferral of tasks that no longer meet release scope or timing
- 👥 **Triage Team sign-off** – Final approval from the cross-functional release authority

This gives you a shared, unambiguous definition of “done” at release scale.

## Automated Release Process

Manual deployments are slow, error-prone, and unsustainable. The Released Method mandates **automation by default** — from build to release.

Automation should include:

- Build pipelines (CI/CD)
- Automated tests (unit, integration, regression)
- Packaging and deployment scripts
- Environment validation checks

Your goal is repeatable, reliable, hands-off releases.

---

## Staging and Production Environments

You ship with confidence when your testing environment mirrors the real world. That’s why the Released Method separates:

- **Staging** – Mirrors production as closely as possible; used for final validation
- **Production** – The live, customer-facing environment

Staging is not optional. It’s your last safety net.

---

## Release Authorization

Shipping software is a team sport. **Release authorization** is a structured process led by the Triage Team, which includes engineering, QA, product, and sometimes support or marketing.

- Any member can veto a release based on serious concerns
- Final go/no-go is based on agreed Quality Bar metrics
- Releasing is a decision — not a default

This ensures accountability without bureaucracy.

---

## Version Control

Version control underpins all of this. It’s more than just source history — it’s the foundation for traceability, rollback, and collaboration.

Your version control strategy should:

- Support parallel development (branching model)
- Tie changes to tasks and bugs (issue tracking integration)
- Maintain clean release tags and history
- Be accessible to all team members, including QA and support

Git is the standard. Use it well.

## Final Word

Release Management isn’t just a checkpoint at the end — it’s a continuous discipline. The Released Method bakes it in from day one to ensure every build is production-worthy, every release is predictable, and your customers never get a “rough edge” build again.
