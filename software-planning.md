# Software Planning and Development

The Software Planning and Development is run according to a cyclical life cycle model as follows:

* Envision
* Prototype
* Architect
* Validate

These phases are defined below

## Envision
In this phase the project is initially defined, it consists of three major processes:

* Brainstorm
* Hypothesis
* Wild Ideas

## Prototype
In this phase, initial prototypes are developed to see if the product is feasible. There are three major processes:

* Build
* Verify
* Fail Fast

## Architect
Once out of the prototype phase, the build of the product components starts for real. Developers follow the processed below:

* Develop
* Document
* Refine

# Validate
Once the product component is ready, it goes through the following major processes:

* Validate
* Optimize
* Enhance
