# Proposal Template
> Customer Ready Document

The proposal template is a detailed proposal document for a client. It will commonly discuss the solution, implementation and pricing. Microsoft have proposal templates [here](https://templates.office.com/en-au/services-proposal-business-blue-design-tm02911896).

This helps a larger client decide on your solution, understand how it will be implemented into their environment and how they will pay for it.

Even with off-the-shelf software, it is important to create a proposal document as it assists you in understanding the adoption of your technology from a customer perspective and ensures you think about and implement the key elements which are:

## Solution Description
Describe the solution in terms the customer uses when choosing the solution.

## Implementation Plan
Describe how this technology will be implemented in the customer environment.

## Migration Plan
If you are moving from legacy technology, describe how this process will occur.

## Payment Plan
Describe how the customer will purchase the software and when they start paying.

## Change Management Plan
Describe how staff will adopt the new technology bd be trained to be effective and proficient in its use.

## Risk Management Plan
Describe any risks the customer may have implementing the technology and how you think they can be mitigated.
