# Startup Checklist

This checklist is your go-to guide for launching and scaling a technology startup. It doesn’t guarantee success — nothing does — but it gives you a solid operational foundation and eliminates the most common early-stage mistakes.

---

## ✅ Team

A strong team isn’t optional — it’s the engine of your startup. Make sure these roles are covered:

* [ ] **Architect** – Owns the system design and technical direction  
* [ ] **Developer(s)** – Build, test, and ship the product  
* [ ] **Tester(s)** – Ensure reliability, performance, and edge-case coverage  
* [ ] **Build/Release Automation** – Sets up the CI/CD pipelines to support rapid delivery  
* [ ] **UX Developer(s)** – Designs workflows that make sense for users  
* [ ] **Designer(s)** – Creates the visual identity and UI components

---

## ⚙️ Process

Define your processes early. It’s how you stay efficient as you grow.

* [ ] **Daily Triage** – Prioritise and unblock the team every day  
* [ ] **Issue Management** – Track and resolve bugs and feature requests  
* [ ] **Task Lifecycle** – Define how tasks move from idea to done  
* [ ] **Automated Build** – CI builds on commit — no manual compiling  
* [ ] **Automated Release** – Scripted, repeatable deployments  
* [ ] **Peer Review** – No code gets merged without another set of eyes  
* [ ] **Quality Bar** – Shared definition of what’s “ready for release”  
* [ ] **Static Code Analysis** – Catch bugs before they’re bugs  
* [ ] **Code Coverage** – Know how much of your code is tested  
* [ ] **Documentation** – Write it down, so people don’t ask twice  
* [ ] **Sprint Planning/Execution** – Use agile ceremonies with intent

---

## 🛠️ Technology

You need the right tools in place before you scale — not after.

* [ ] **Issue Tracker** – JIRA, GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.  
* [ ] **Task Planning System** – Kanban or sprint-based  
* [ ] **Version Control** – Git is mandatory; use it properly  
* [ ] **Dev Analytics** – Track velocity, throughput, and cycle time  
* [ ] **Artifact Repository** – Store built packages safely  
* [ ] **Automated Build System** – CI pipelines for consistency  
* [ ] **Automated Test Suite** – Unit, integration, and regression tests  
* [ ] **Automated Release Pipeline** – One-click deploys to staging and prod  
* [ ] **Documentation System** – Wiki, Notion, GitBook — just make it accessible

---

## 👥 Minimum Viable Team

Startups move fast — you need a well-rounded core from day one:

* [ ] **Hustler** – Drives the business: sales, marketing, partnerships, and funding  
* [ ] **Hacker** – Builds the product: writes code, solves problems, scales infrastructure  
* [ ] **Hipster** – Owns the user experience: design, UX, storytelling, brand

Don’t start until you’ve got all three.

## 📚 Documentation

Good documentation makes everything easier — onboarding, support, scaling, and investment.

* [ ] **Code Comments** – Keep them relevant and helpful  
* [ ] **API Docs** – Clearly explain endpoints, payloads, and auth flows  
* [ ] **Architecture & Design Docs** – The “why” behind your system decisions  
* [ ] **Risk Register** – Track risks and mitigations like a pro  
* [ ] **Sprint/Project Planning** – What’s happening, when, and why  
* [ ] **End-User Docs** – Help users get value from your product  
* [ ] **SDK Docs** – Make it dead simple for others to build on your platform

---

## Final Word

Use this checklist to build your foundation. It won’t eliminate risk, but it will make you more resilient, more credible, and more likely to ship something that matters.
