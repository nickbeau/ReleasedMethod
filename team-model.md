# Team Model
The Team model consists of a number of roles and functions. However there is a minimum viable team required for any startup. In our experience, any team with less than the below roles is unlikely to succeed. *Thanks to Angela Bee Chan, from [Hackathons Australia](https://www.hackathonsaustralia.com/) for the inspiration for this one*.

At a high level The ‘hacker’ is someone who can code, the ‘hustler’ brings the concept together, whilst the ‘hipster’ is the designer. 

# Minimum Viable Team
## Hustler
Commonly the CEO or "business person" in a startup, the Hustler is responsible for the overall idea, the marketing and business strategy, sales, growth and how the business spends and generates money.

## Hacker
The Hacker needs to have the skills to build the product that the startup will sell. Whilst having a single hacker is superb for prototype, you will need a Tester to get into production.

## Hipster
The Hipster has the design skills in the team. They should be comfortable doing everything from designing user interface, plotting user experience to building websites and cute emails. They should be able to generate graphics, logos and more.

# Release Team
The Minimum viable team will only get you to prototype (which is a way to seek funding). If you want to actually release a product to market, you will need a few more roles filled.

## Accountant
Good accountants are worth their weight in gold. You will need accounts, cards, books, ledgers, invoicing, billing systems and more.

## Lawyer
You will need terms and conditions, NDAs, Privacy Policies, contracts and many more documents.

## Tester
The software your build will have bugs. It will always have bugs. The role of the tester is to make it have less bugs. There is no such thing as no bugs. Once you are cool with that, hire a tester who can also code and you'll have automated test and releases all day long.

# Scale Team
Once you're in market, you will need to scale. The following roles are your scale roles:

## Support Team
These folks speak to customers with problems and help them.

## Developers
These folks write more and more code.

## Desginers
These folks make more and more pretty stuff

## Testers
Still trying to get rid of bugs

## Admin
You know you've made it when you need Accounts people, sales people and HR People. If you need these before profitability you are probably doing something wrong.
