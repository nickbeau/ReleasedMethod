# Team Model

The **Released Method** recognises that startups live or die by the strength of their teams. This team model maps out the essential roles needed at each stage of growth — from day-one hustle through to scale.

Inspired by insights from Angela Bee Chan of [Hackathons Australia](https://www.hackathonsaustralia.com/), the model focuses on lean execution early, followed by smart role expansion as the product matures.

## 🧪 Minimum Viable Team

Your startup doesn’t need a 30-person team on day one — but it does need coverage across **business, tech, and design**. That’s where the classic trio comes in:

### 🧠 Hustler  
- **Who**: The founder, CEO, or commercial lead  
- **Drives**: Vision, business strategy, customer acquisition, sales, marketing, revenue, and funding  
- **Why it matters**: No one buys unless someone sells.

### 💻 Hacker  
- **Who**: The technical co-founder or first engineer  
- **Builds**: The first version of the product  
- **Expansion**: Eventually joined by testers or automation engineers as technical complexity grows  

### 🎨 Hipster  
- **Who**: The designer or frontend lead  
- **Owns**: UI/UX, branding, website, and visual storytelling  
- **Impact**: Turns your product into something people *want* to use, not just *can* use  

This trio forms your initial launch team. Without them, you’ll be building blind.

## 🚀 Release-Ready Team

Once you're past MVP and aiming for market, you need to strengthen operational and legal foundations:

### 💰 Accountant  
- **Handles**: Bookkeeping, invoicing, tax compliance, financial reporting  
- **Why now**: You’re starting to generate revenue — time to track every dollar.

### ⚖️ Lawyer  
- **Advises on**: Contracts, IP, privacy, NDAs, compliance  
- **Protects**: Your business and your product from early legal landmines

### 🧪 Tester  
- **Focuses on**: Manual and exploratory testing  
- **Adds value**: Catches issues before your customers do  
- **Next stage**: Can grow into automated QA and CI/CD pipeline integration

## 📈 Scale-Up Team

As your user base grows, so does your team. You’ll need to invest in specialised roles to support scale and stability:

### 🎧 Support Team  
- **Frontline**: Handles customer queries, bug reports, and onboarding  
- **Retention booster**: Happy users stick around and spread the word

### 👨‍💻 Developers  
- **Expand capacity**: Build new features, squash bugs, and maintain the codebase  
- **Essential for**: Keeping up with demand and scaling architecture

### 🖌️ Designers  
- **Evolve the experience**: Iterate on UI/UX, brand, and communication  
- **Critical for**: Differentiation and usability

### 🧪 Testers  
- **Go deep**: Expand coverage, build automated test suites, stress test edge cases  
- **Part of**: A mature, sustainable release cycle

### 🧾 Administrative Roles  
- **Includes**: HR, finance, legal ops, sales ops, and executive assistants  
- **When to add**: Post-product-market fit, when complexity starts to bite  
- **Why**: Free up your core team to focus on growth, not admin
