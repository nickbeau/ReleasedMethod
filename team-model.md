# Team Model

In the Released Method, the team model is foundational for a startup's success, delineating essential roles and functions necessary at various stages of growth. Inspired by insights from Angela Bee Chan of [Hackathons Australia](https://www.hackathonsaustralia.com/), this model outlines the minimum viable team structure and the additional roles required as the startup matures and scales.

## Minimum Viable Team
### Hustler
- **Role**: Often the CEO or business leader.
- **Responsibilities**: Drives the overall vision, business strategy, marketing, sales, financial planning, and revenue generation.

### Hacker
- **Skills**: Essential coding and technical skills to build the initial product.
- **Expansion**: As the startup progresses, the need for a dedicated Tester becomes crucial for quality assurance.

### Hipster
- **Design Expertise**: Responsible for user interface and experience design, branding, website development, and visual communication.

## Release Team
To transition from prototype to market-ready product, additional roles are vital:

### Accountant
- **Value**: Manages financial operations including accounting, invoicing, and billing systems.
- **Importance**: Crucial for financial health and compliance.

### Lawyer
- **Legal Guidance**: Provides essential legal support, drafting terms, NDAs, privacy policies, and contracts.

### Tester
- **Quality Assurance**: Focuses on identifying and reducing bugs in the software.
- **Evolution**: In advanced stages, can contribute to automated testing and release processes.

## Scale Team
As the startup enters the market and begins to grow, the team needs to expand to support scaling:

### Support Team
- **Customer Interaction**: Addresses customer inquiries and troubleshoots issues, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Developers
- **Expanded Development**: Takes on the development of new features, maintenance, and ongoing improvements to the software.

### Designers

### Administrative Roles
- **Operational Support**: Includes roles in accounting, sales, HR, and administration, crucial for a growing organization.
- **Timing**: These roles become necessary as the startup achieves profitability and operational complexity increases.

By adhering to this team model, a startup can effectively navigate through different phases of its lifecycle, from inception and prototyping to market release and eventual scaling. The right team composition at each stage is essential for balancing innovation, technical excellence, business acumen, and operational efficiency.
