# Why?
There are a number of software development methodologies available today, from Waterfall through to Scrum and RUP. In fact there is a nice discussion of all of them [here](https://www.weblineindia.com/blog/top-15-software-development-methodologies-with-advantages-and-disadvantages/), however many of them attempt to be generic and cover every conceptual approach. The Released Method is focussed on one goal, that of delivering a working and successful product to market.

The Released Method aims to deliver a commercially capable release, in the shortest amount of time and with the highest quality to meet the lean approach of the modern startup. It is assumed that the team have total executive control over the project and the only external influences are customers and the market.

It is not designed to work within large enterprise as they have a significant amount of internal stakeholders and product owners and it is not expected that this approach works well in that scenario.

It is designed, however to work well in a skunk works style environment and is tailored to delivering innovatove or ground breaking software never seen before.
