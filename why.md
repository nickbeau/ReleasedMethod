# Why Choose the Released Method?

In a world full of software development methodologies, most frameworks either aim for broad applicability or lean heavily on dogma. The **Released Method** is different. It’s purpose-built for startups, skunkworks teams, and innovation-led environments that demand speed, adaptability, and quality without the bloat.

## 🎯 Clear Focus: Get to Market, Fast

The primary objective of the Released Method is simple:  
**Deliver a commercially viable product efficiently and predictably.**

It’s designed for projects with direct executive oversight, minimal red tape, and tight market feedback loops — ideal for:

- Early-stage startups  
- Product incubators  
- Internal innovation teams  
- Founder-led technical builds

When time, budget, and reputation are on the line, the Released Method provides a framework that delivers.

## 🔑 What Sets It Apart

Unlike generic methodologies, the Released Method is fine-tuned for execution:

- **Quality-First Mindset** – High-quality, production-ready code is the default  
- **Embedded Testing** – Unit, integration, and regression testing are built into the lifecycle  
- **Automated Release** – CI/CD pipelines ensure repeatable, low-risk deployments  
- **Lean Team Model** – Clear role definitions matched to the startup phase  
- **Agility Without Chaos** – Responsive to change without sacrificing structure  
- **Cost-Conscious Delivery** – Budget-aware planning that still delivers value

## 💡 A Realistic Business Case

Let’s be blunt: software isn’t like building a bridge.

- Requirements shift  
- Markets move  
- Users surprise you  
- Timelines slip  
- And budgets are always tighter than you’d like

Traditional “command-and-control” or heavyweight methodologies break down in this environment. Even pure Agile, while flexible, often lacks enough structure to keep fast-moving teams aligned and accountable.

### 🚀 The Released Method Difference

The Released Method brings discipline to agility — and structure to startup speed:

- **Sprint-Based Planning** – Each sprint has clear goals, a defined budget, and tight feedback loops  
- **Built for Change** – Handles evolving scope without derailing the roadmap  
- **Predictable Outcomes** – Increases control over time, cost, and quality — even under uncertainty  
- **Outcome-Driven** – Every cycle ends with a working, shippable increment  
- **Aligned With Reality** – Built from 20+ years of real-world product delivery, not academic theory

## 🧩 In Summary

The Released Method is the execution engine your startup needs — especially when:

- You need to ship fast but not break everything  
- You care about code quality and customer experience  
- You want structure without bureaucracy  
- You can’t afford to get it wrong the first time

It’s not a silver bullet, but it *is* the pragmatic, founder-tested framework for building high-quality software with limited resources and evolving goals.
