# Why?

There are a number of software development methodologies available today, from Waterfall through to Scrum and RUP. In fact there is a nice discussion of all of them [here](https://www.weblineindia.com/blog/top-15-software-development-methodologies-with-advantages-and-disadvantages/), however many of them attempt to be generic and cover every conceptual approach. The Released Method is focussed on one goal, that of delivering a working and successful product to market.

The Released Method aims to deliver a commercially capable release, in the shortest amount of time and with the highest quality to meet the lean approach of the modern startup. It is assumed that the team have total executive control over the project and the only external influences are customers and the market.

It is not designed to work within large enterprise as they have a significant amount of internal stakeholders and product owners and it is not expected that this approach works well in that scenario.

It is designed, however to work well in a skunk works style environment and is tailored to delivering innovative or ground breaking software never seen before.

Key Features of the Released Method are:

* Quality Software
* Testing
* Automated Release
* Team Management
* Agility
* Reduced Cost

# Business Case
Embarking on a new software development project is a voyage into the unknown. Unlike constructing a bridge, it is not possible to predict how long a software development project will take as there are a significant number of unknown items and items that will be refined along the way.

Agile development also makes it difficult to accurately predict the cost of a project as the process of developing software in an agile fashion is fluid and can change.

Rather than use command-and-control techniques to control such a project, entrepreneurs need a way to predict outcomes and costs. The Released Method assures a level of quality deliverable and breaks the delivery into sprints, short bounded work units with agreed budget, time and outcome.

*It should be noted, that a sprint is an intention, and as the project matures these get increasingly predictable*.

Given it is not possible to accurately predict the cost and duration of all but the most simple software projects, the Released Method allows delivery within a budget, ensuring that should cost be fixed, the methodology is agile enough to adapt cost and time to suffice.

In addition, using such a tried and tested methodology, users can be assured of a "decent" result, within the various constraints.
