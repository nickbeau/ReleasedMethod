# Why Choose the Released Method?

In the diverse landscape of software development methodologies, each with its own strengths and focus, the Released Method stands out for its specific orientation towards delivering successful and high-quality software products for modern startups. Unlike more generic methodologies, it is fine-tuned for environments that demand rapid innovation and lean operations.

## Focused Goal
The primary aim of the Released Method is to bring a commercially viable product to the market efficiently. It caters specifically to projects with direct executive control, where the principal external influences are market demands and customer feedback, making it ideal for startups and skunkworks projects.

## Key Features
The Released Method distinguishes itself through several critical features:

- **Quality Software**: Emphasizes the development of high-quality, robust software solutions.
- **Testing**: Integrates comprehensive testing strategies to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Automated Release**: Utilizes automated release processes for efficient and consistent deployment.
- **Team Management**: Focuses on effective team collaboration and role definition.
- **Agility**: Adapts quickly to changing requirements and market conditions.
- **Reduced Cost**: Aims to minimize costs without compromising on the quality of the output.

## Business Case
The volatile and unpredictable nature of software development projects, especially in a startup context, poses unique challenges:

- **Predictability Issues**: Unlike physical engineering projects like bridge construction, software projects have numerous unknowns that make cost and time predictions challenging.
- **Agile Flexibility**: Agile development methodologies add to this unpredictability, as they are designed to be fluid and adaptable.
- **Control vs Prediction**: Traditional command-and-control approaches are less effective in such dynamic environments.

### The Released Method's Approach
- **Sprint-Based Delivery**: Breaks down the project into sprints, each with defined objectives, budgets, and timelines. This approach increases predictability and control over the projectâ€™s progression.
- **Adaptability**: The method is agile enough to adapt to fixed budgets and changing requirements, ensuring delivery within set constraints.
- **Assured Quality and Outcome**: Even with budget and time constraints, the Released Method is structured to deliver a reliable and quality product.

In summary, the Released Method is a tailored solution for startups and innovative software projects that require a balance between agility, quality, and cost-effectiveness. It is designed to navigate the complexities of modern software development, providing a structured yet flexible framework that adapts to the unique challenges of each project.
