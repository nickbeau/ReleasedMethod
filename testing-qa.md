# Testing and Quality Assurance
Testing and Quality Assurance follows a cyclical model as follows:

## Testing
  * **Unit Tests** are automated components of electronic testing of the software to ensure functions operate as desired 
  * **Code Analysis** is the process of analysing code for defects at a line by line level using automated tools. 
  * **Automated Tests** commonly automate the user interface and test the UI does what is required. 
  * **Manual Tests** are manual tests performed by humans to ensure the application works as desired.

## Triage
Triage is the process of analyising requests to the project team and managing them in a highly efficient manner. In short, anyone can raise a request or issue for the team and it is the triage team which uses the triage process to manage and process the request. 
 
 During a short meeting the team agrees one of the following actions on a request. 
 
 * Investigate - the request will be investigated further 
 * Approve - the request will be done by the team. 
 * Reject - the request will be denied 
 * Defer - the request will be deferred
  
 * Resolution
  * Resolve
  * Revert
* Acceptance
  * Validate
  * Regression Test
  * Close
