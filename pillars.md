# Pillars of the Released Process

The Released Process is founded on six essential pillars that guide the end-to-end development and management of software projects. Each pillar represents a critical aspect of the software lifecycle, from planning to sales, ensuring a comprehensive and effective approach to software delivery.

## 1. Management Reporting
[Management Reporting](management-reporting.md) plays a pivotal role in providing insights into the project's progress. It involves tracking and reporting on key metrics like burndown rates, test and regression rates, development cadence, and estimated completion dates. Effective management reporting enables informed decision-making and ensures transparency across all levels of the project.

## 2. Software Planning and Development
[Software Planning and Development](software-planning.md) is the cornerstone of the process, where ideas are transformed into actionable plans and tangible products. This pillar encompasses defining project scopes, setting timelines, resource allocation, and adopting agile methodologies for iterative development. It ensures that development efforts align with business objectives and customer needs.

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
[Testing and Quality Assurance](testing-qa.md) focuses on maintaining the highest standards of software quality. This includes implementing robust testing frameworks, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices, and ensuring that every release meets stringent quality benchmarks. This pillar is crucial for identifying and rectifying defects early in the development cycle, thereby reducing risks and enhancing product reliability.

## 4. Release Management
[Release Management](release-management.md) involves the strategies and processes used to manage, plan, schedule, and control a software build through different stages and environments. This includes deployment methodologies, version control, and ensuring seamless transitions between development, testing, and production environments. Effective release management ensures that software releases are reliable and delivered in a timely manner.

## 5. Documentation
[Documentation](documentation.md) is essential for providing clear and comprehensive information about the software. This pillar covers everything from technical documentation for developers to user manuals for end-users. Well-structured documentation is vital for supporting both the development process and the user experience, facilitating easier adoption and usage of the software.

## 6. Selling
[Selling](sales-kit.md) is the final pillar, encompassing the strategies and materials used to market and sell the software. This includes developing sales kits, marketing strategies, pricing models, and customer outreach programs. The selling process is crucial for ensuring that the software reaches its intended audience and achieves commercial success.

Together, these six pillars form the foundation of the Released Process, creating a robust framework for managing software projects from conception to market. Each pillar is interdependent and crucial for the overall success of the software, ensuring that projects are not only technically sound but also commercially viable and aligned with market needs.
