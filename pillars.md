# Pillars of the Released Process

The **Released Process** is built on six core pillars that support the full lifecycle of software delivery — from initial planning through to commercial success. Each pillar addresses a critical dimension of what it takes to deliver great software at scale: strategy, execution, quality, release, clarity, and customer reach.

## 1. [Management Reporting](management-reporting.md)

Management reporting provides the visibility needed to steer a project with confidence. It tracks critical metrics like burndown, test coverage, regressions, cadence, cost, and delivery estimates. The goal is simple: deliver insights, not noise — and enable fast, informed decision-making at every level.

## 2. [Software Planning and Development](software-planning.md)

This is where ideas become reality. From defining scope and timelines to allocating resources and adopting agile practices, this pillar ensures development is aligned with business goals. It’s not just about writing code — it’s about delivering the right thing, the right way, at the right time.

---

## 3. [Testing and Quality Assurance](testing-qa.md)

Quality isn’t optional — it’s embedded. This pillar covers robust test frameworks, automation, CI/CD pipelines, and regression tracking. The aim is to catch issues early, ship confidently, and maintain high standards without slowing down delivery.

---

## 4. [Release Management](release-management.md)

This is where planning meets execution. Release management defines how software moves through environments — from dev to test to prod — with minimal risk and maximum control. It includes deployment strategies, versioning, environment control, and go-live readiness.

---

## 5. [Documentation](documentation.md)

Documentation underpins everything: onboarding, development, support, and adoption. This pillar covers technical guides, SDKs, install instructions, release notes, and user-facing content. Good documentation saves time, reduces friction, and increases product value.

---

## 6. [Selling](sales-kit.md)

The final pillar ensures your software reaches the market and resonates. This includes sales kits, pricing models, positioning, customer targeting, and marketing assets. Selling isn’t a separate phase — it’s an integrated part of building something people want and are willing to pay for.

---

## Bringing It All Together

These six pillars form a complete, battle-tested framework for managing modern software delivery. They're not standalone functions — they’re interdependent. Weakness in one affects the others.

The Released Process brings them together in a structured, adaptable way — ensuring every product is not just built well, but delivered, adopted, and scaled successfully.
