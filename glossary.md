# Glossary

---

## Burndown  
A *burndown chart* visually represents the team’s progress by showing how much work remains in a sprint or project over time. Commonly used in agile environments, it tracks user stories or tasks (often measured in hours or story points) against the sprint timeline to indicate whether the team is on pace to meet delivery goals.

---

## User Story  
A *user story* is a concise, user-centric description of a software feature or requirement. It typically follows the format:  
**As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]**.  
User stories ensure work is focused on delivering value and are the foundation for planning, estimation, and discussion in agile sprints.

---

## Iteration  
An *iteration* (or sprint) is a fixed timebox (usually 1–4 weeks) during which the team delivers a working increment of software. Each iteration includes planning, development, testing, and review, enabling fast feedback and continuous improvement.

---

## Quality Bar  
The *quality bar* defines the criteria a feature or release must meet before being considered complete. It typically includes:  
- All tasks closed  
- No Sev 1 / Pri 1 bugs  
- Completed testing and documentation  
- Approval by the triage team  
This ensures consistency, stability, and stakeholder confidence.

---

## Triage  
*Triage* is the process of reviewing, prioritising, and assigning bugs, tasks, and change requests. It ensures that high-priority work is addressed quickly, low-priority issues are logged for later, and nothing slips through the cracks.

---

## Severity (Bug)  
*Severity* indicates the **impact** of a bug on functionality:  
- **Critical** – Breaks core functionality or causes data loss  
- **Major** – High impact, with a workaround possible  
- **Minor** – Low impact, mostly cosmetic or edge-case related

---

## Priority (Bug)  
*Priority* defines the **urgency** of fixing a bug relative to other work. Set during triage:  
- **P1** – Immediate fix required  
- **P2** – Fix in next sprint  
- **P3** – Fix if time allows  
- **Deferred** – Logged but not currently scheduled

---

## Repro Steps  
Short for *reproduction steps*, this refers to the detailed instructions necessary to consistently replicate a bug. A good repro includes:  
- Preconditions  
- Exact steps taken  
- Expected vs actual result  
Without this, bugs are harder to fix and verify.

---

## Sprint  
A *sprint* is a short, time-boxed iteration in agile development, usually 1–4 weeks. Each sprint includes planning, execution, review, and retrospective. The goal is to ship a working, tested increment of software by the end of each sprint.

---

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
An *MVP* is the simplest version of a product that delivers value to early adopters. It’s built to validate assumptions, gather feedback, and test product-market fit without investing in full-scale development.

---

## CI/CD  
*Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment* is a development practice that automates the building, testing, and deployment of code.  
- **CI** ensures code is regularly merged and tested  
- **CD** automates the release process for faster delivery

---

## Static Code Analysis  
Automated code review performed without executing the program. It detects syntax errors, coding standard violations, potential bugs, and security vulnerabilities — often as part of the quality bar process.

---

## Code Coverage  
A metric that measures the percentage of your source code tested by automated tests. While 100% coverage isn’t always practical, aiming for **80%+** helps ensure confidence in code stability.

---

## Regression  
A *regression* is a bug introduced by a change that breaks functionality that previously worked. Prevented through strong test coverage, automated test suites, and post-fix validation.

---

## Release Authorization  
The structured decision point before deploying to production. In the Released Method, this includes:
- Quality bar review  
- Triage team approval  
- Optional team-wide veto  
It ensures releases are stable, intentional, and aligned.

---

## Battlecard  
A *battlecard* is a sales enablement tool. It summarises key talking points, competitive differentiators, objection handling tips, and product strengths — giving sales teams a fast reference during live calls and pitches.

---

## Proposal Template  
A standardised document that communicates your solution, pricing, scope, and value to prospects. It ensures professionalism and consistency in every sales engagement.

---

## SDK (Software Development Kit)  
An *SDK* includes APIs, libraries, tools, and documentation that help external developers build on or integrate with your platform. High-quality SDKs reduce support load and increase adoption.

---

## Hustler / Hacker / Hipster  
A popular trio representing the minimum viable founding team:  
- **Hustler** – Drives sales, partnerships, business growth  
- **Hacker** – Builds the product and manages tech  
- **Hipster** – Crafts the user experience, branding, and design
