## Burndown
A *burndown chart* visually represents the rate at which a team is completing tasks against the total effort required. It's a tool used in agile software development to track the progress of user stories (tasks or requirements) during each iteration. The chart typically shows the remaining work (often in terms of hours or story points) against time, providing a clear picture of whether the team is on track to complete the work in the given timeframe.

## User Story
A *user story* is a short, simple description of a software feature from the perspective of the end user. User stories help to create a simplified description of a requirement and consist of three aspects: who (the user), what (the need or goal), and why (the benefit or value). They are a fundamental component in Agile and Scrum frameworks, acting as the primary unit of communication and planning, ensuring that development work focuses on user needs and value.

## Iteration
An *iteration* in software development is a specific time frame during which a team works to complete a set number of user stories or tasks. It is a core concept in iterative development methodologies like Agile, where a project is divided into smaller segments with each segment being developed, tested, and reviewed in a repetitive cycle. Iterations are typically short (often 1-4 weeks) and aim to produce a working version of the product with each cycle, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation of the project goals and priorities.
