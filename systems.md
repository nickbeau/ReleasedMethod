# Systems

In the Released Method, systems are integral components that facilitate efficient and effective software development, testing, and collaboration. Below is an enhanced overview of the critical systems vital for the success of a technology startup or software development project.

## Document Management
**Importance**: Central to managing and maintaining project documentation.
- **Version Control Integration**: Ideally, integrates with the software version control system, syncing documentation with software changes.
- **Accessibility and Searchability**: Ensures easy access and searchability of documents for the team.

## Software Version Control
**Criticality**: Essential for tracking and managing changes in the software.
- **Popular Systems**: Git is increasingly the standard, but others like Subversion are also used.
- **Branching and Merging**: Facilitates efficient handling of multiple development streams, like feature development and bug fixing.

## Work Item Management
**Functionality**: Manages tasks and tracks progress.
- **Types of Work Items**: Includes bugs, tasks, features, and user stories.
- **States of Work Items**: Follows states like New, Active, Resolved, Documentation Required, Testing Required, and Closed.
- **Integration with Sprints**: Aligns with agile methodologies, linking work items to sprints or iterations for better tracking.

## Release and Build
**Automation**: Crucial for consistent and reliable software delivery.
- **Multiple Environments**: Supports testing in various environments before market release.
- **Frequency**: Adaptable to different release frequencies, from rapid deployments to scheduled releases.

## Automated Testing
**Necessity**: Increases efficiency and reliability of testing.
- **Types**: Ranges from unit testing to full-scale automated user experience testing.
- **Code Coverage Goal**: Aim for over 80% coverage to ensure robustness before initial release.

## Management Reporting
**Insights**: Provides visibility into project status and progress.
- **Dashboards and Reports**: Tools to visualize project velocity, status, and metrics, guiding decision-making and planning.

## Collaboration
**Connectivity**: Facilitates team communication and collaboration, especially important for remote or distributed teams.
- **Tools**: Preference for platforms like Microsoft Teams, offering instant messaging, voice and video calls, and document sharing.
- **Record Keeping**: Maintains records of communications for reference and continuity.

## Development Tools
**Resource Investment**: Allocating resources for the best available development tools.
- **IDE Selection**: Choose IDEs that best suit the project's technology stack.
- **Library and Tool Access**: Ensure the team has access to necessary libraries and development tools to enhance productivity and innovation.

These systems, when effectively implemented and utilized, create a robust infrastructure for software development, enabling teams to work efficiently, adapt to changes, and deliver high-quality software products.
