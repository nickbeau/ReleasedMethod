# Systems

In the Released Method, **systems are not just tools — they’re enablers**. They underpin everything from collaboration and tracking to automation and deployment. The right systems, implemented well, remove friction, reduce risk, and supercharge productivity.

This guide outlines the essential systems every technology startup or software team should have in place to support high-velocity, high-quality delivery.

## 📄 Document Management

**Why it matters**: Documentation is only useful if people can find it — and trust it.

- **Version-Controlled** – Tightly integrated with your codebase or change history  
- **Searchable and Accessible** – Easy to navigate and locate what matters  
- **Centralised** – One source of truth, not scattered across drives or inboxes  

🛠 Tools: Notion, Confluence, GitBook, Markdown in GitHub/GitLab

---

## 🔁 Software Version Control

**Non-negotiable**: You need version control from day one.

- **Git is the standard** – Use hosted services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket  
- **Branching Strategy** – Define how features, hotfixes, and releases are managed  
- **History and Traceability** – Know who changed what, when, and why  

🚨 Tip: Enforce pull requests and code reviews. It’s your first quality gate.

## 🗂️ Work Item Management

**Purpose**: Organise your backlog, prioritise work, and track progress.

- **Work Item Types** – Features, bugs, tasks, tech debt, and spikes  
- **State Lifecycle** – New → Active → In Test → In Docs → Closed  
- **Sprint Integration** – Link tasks to sprints or iterations for visibility and accountability  

🛠 Tools: Azure DevOps, Jira, Linear, GitHub Projects

---

## 🚀 Build and Release Automation

**Goal**: Deliver with confidence, speed, and zero surprises.

- **Multiple Environments** – Dev, staging, UAT, and production  
- **Scripted and Repeatable** – No manual deployment steps allowed  
- **Release Cadence** – Supports both rapid and scheduled release cycles  

🛠 Tools: GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, Octopus Deploy

---

## ✅ Automated Testing

**Why it matters**: You can’t scale quality without automation.

- **Test Types** – Unit, integration, regression, and UI tests  
- **Coverage Targets** – Aim for 80%+ code coverage pre-release  
- **Fast Feedback** – Tests should run automatically on every push or PR  

🛠 Tools: Jest, NUnit, PyTest, Selenium, Cypress

---

## 📈 Management Reporting

**Purpose**: Make data-driven decisions, not guesses.

- **Dashboards** – Visualise burndown, velocity, cycle time, code quality  
- **Status Reporting** – Show what’s done, what’s blocked, and what’s next  
- **Forecasting** – Estimate delivery dates and resource usage  

🛠 Tools: Power BI, Looker, Azure DevOps Dashboards, Jira Reports

---

## 💬 Collaboration

**Essentials**: Communication must be fast, fluid, and recorded.

- **Centralised Chat** – Real-time communication via Teams or Slack  
- **Video & Screen Sharing** – For pair programming, demos, and retrospectives  
- **Persistent Channels** – Keep conversations searchable and structured  
- **Linked to Work** – Conversations should tie back to tasks, PRs, and goals  

🛠 Tools: Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Miro, Loom

---

## 🧰 Development Tools

**Investment**: Good tools make good developers faster.

- **IDE of Choice** – Based on stack and preference (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)  
- **Toolchain Access** – Linting, debugging, profiling, testing  
- **Library Management** – Package managers (npm, NuGet, pip) must be secure and up to date  

🛠 Support your team with licenses, automation, and performance tools.

## Final Word

The right systems won’t fix a broken team — but the wrong systems *will* slow down a good one. In the Released Method, systems aren’t an afterthought. They’re baked in, integrated, and constantly improved to support fast, sustainable, and high-quality software delivery.
