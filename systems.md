# Systems
Systems are as follows:

## Document Management
A good document management system which exhibits and delivers version control is critical to the success of a solutions. If the team are up to it, a document management system which integrates with the Software Version Control System is also extremely useful and keeps the documentation of the project inline with the software itself.

## Software Version Control
Of critical importance is a software version control system. Examples of this are [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) and many more, although the growing de-facto standard is becoming Git. A software version control system should allow your team to change and grow the software in a managed way across different branches, versions and be able to both develop new software and fix bugs.

## Work Item Management
Like traditional project managed projects, software projects are managed through work items. Work items are records which contain and manage atomic pieces of work that (normally) can be performed by a single developer or team. Work items are of different types and have different states. Common types are:

* Bug
* Task
* Feature
* User Story

Work items are commonly associated with iterations or sprints and can follow the common states:

* New
* Active
* Resolved
* Documentation Required
* Testing Required
* Closed
  

## Release and Build
Once the software is ready to be compiled and delivered to market, it is imperative that this is done through an automated system. It's also common that you will have several environments to test and perform quality assurance on the software before releasing it out to the paying client base.

Software projects are extremely agile things. With the advent of cloud computing, many software teams release incredibly regularly (10 minutes for facebook). This necessitates the need for an automated system to perform this.

## Automated Testing
Whilst many teams resort to allowing the team to test the software, the more a project grows, the more it needs automated testing. Automated testing can be anything from unit testing to full automated user experience testing. We recommend a code coverage of over 80% before initial release.

## Management Reporting
What use are all these systems without knowing what is really going on or when you will ship. Reports and Dashboard on the status, velocity and other statistics of the product set are also incredibly important.

## Collaboration
Teams are not commonly together all the time. Tools to collaborate are incredibly important. We find that startup teams communicate best using instant messaging that keeps a record, daily meetings via voice and video and a comprehensive document store with fantastic search.

We currently lean towards Microsoft teams.

## Development Tools
A rich set of development tools are really important. Invest in the best IDE's for the software type you are developing, ensure your team have access to the best libraries and tools.
