# Introduction
Welcome to the Released Method. This is a method for the delivery and management of large scale software systems. Birthed as agile methodologies were first introduced, the Released Method aims to integrate together all of the aspects of a software product team to ensure that what is delivered is extremely high quality and meets the needs and expectations of the customer.

Whilst the Released Method is an effective mechanism to deliver high quality software, it also relies on people. The team need to have specific skills based on what activities they are to perform, and also need to have effective communications skills.

Finally comes a reliance on technology. Whilst the original author has his specific favorite technology stack for development it is feasible to implement the released method using many combinations of technology. See the technology reference architecture for more information on the technology requirements.
