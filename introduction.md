# Introduction

Welcome to the Released Method. This is a method for the delivery and management of large scale software systems. Birthed as agile methodologies were first introduced, the Released Method aims to integrate all of the aspects of a software product team to ensure that what is delivered is extremely high quality and meets the needs and expectations of the customer.

Whilst the Released Method is an effective mechanism to deliver high-quality software, it also relies on people. The team needs to have specific skills based on what activities they are to perform, and also need to have effective communications skills.

Finally comes a reliance on technology. Whilst the original author has his specific favorite technology stack for development it is feasible to implement the released method using many combinations of technology. See the technology reference architecture for more information on the technology requirements.

The diagram above shows the **People, Process, Technology** triangle. Optimal projects are seen where the investment in all three is balanced. One of the core goals of the Released Method is to balance the three investments as follows:

| Area | Investment |
| ---- | ---------- |
| People | By using an effective team model, and ensuring that all critical functions are well-staffed, the people segment is managed. |
| Process | By implementing all the pillars of the Released Method, the process segment is managed |
| Technology | By integrating solutions for all the systems requirements of the Released Method, the technology segment is managed |

## History

The initial genesis of the Released Method came from the author's time at Microsoft at the turn of the Millenium. That was at the stage where the software industry realized that the "Waterfall Method" assumed to be espoused by Dr. Winston W Royce, was by accident more likely to be an agile methodology and the industry struggled to correct 40 years of incorrect process teaching and invented sometimes crazy ideas such as Xtreme Programming, Scrum and others.

Whilst some of the practices in those methodologies are "silly" or "strange", their approach is in the main correct. The Released Method can, therefore, be thought of as an implementation of a serious agile methodology for the 2020s.

## Approach

By working on a significant number of software development projects over the years, the released method offers a real-world-tested, comprehensive view on software development best practices.
