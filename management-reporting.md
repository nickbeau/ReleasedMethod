# Management Reporting

**Management reporting** is essential for tracking progress, anticipating issues, and communicating project health to stakeholders — whether that’s internal leadership, external investors, or delivery teams. Done right, it provides not just status updates, but actionable insight.

## Key Outcomes

Management reporting should produce a clear picture of how the project is progressing. Core outputs include:

- **Burndown** – Visualises how fast work is being completed versus total effort remaining.
- **Test & Regression Rates** – Reflects code stability and testing rigour over time.
- **Development Cadence** – Shows the team’s delivery rhythm and any variation.
- **Estimated Dates** – Forecasts for milestones and key deliverables.
- **Cost & Duration** – Tracks budget versus burn and projected completion time.

## How to Report

The best reports combine numbers, visuals, and trends in a way that’s quick to grasp and hard to ignore. Use charts and concise commentary over spreadsheets full of noise.

### Burndown Charts

Burndown charts are a staple of agile delivery — and for good reason. They offer a fast, intuitive view of progress over time.

Key elements:

- **Total Effort (Y-Axis)** – Work remaining, often measured in story points or hours.
- **Time (X-Axis)** – Iterations, sprints, or calendar days.
- **Velocity** – Average rate at which the team completes work.
- **Remaining vs Completed** – Visually shows if you’re on track or falling behind.
- **Projected Completion** – Based on current trend lines.

> ✅ **Tip:** Use a running average for velocity rather than a per-sprint measure to smooth out anomalies.

### Test & Regression Metrics

Tracking test and regression metrics helps keep quality visible — not just a “dev problem.”

Report on:

- **Test Coverage Growth** – More tests over time = confidence in growing codebase.
- **Bug Trends** – Track open bugs, fix rates, and age of unresolved issues.
- **Zero-Bug Bounce** – A milestone where all known issues are cleared (if only briefly).
- **Regression Rate** – How often new changes break previously working features. Lower = healthier codebase.

> 📉 High regression = tech debt or flaky tests. Either way, it’s a red flag.

### Final Word

Management reporting isn't about ticking boxes. It’s about maintaining visibility, enabling smart decisions, and catching issues early — before they derail timelines or blow budgets.

Keep it:

- **Focused** – Stick to what matters.
- **Honest** – Don’t sugar-coat or hide behind averages.
- **Regular** – Weekly is typical; fortnightly is the minimum.
