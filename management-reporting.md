# Management Reporting
Management Reporting is critical to inform management, project investors and the overall executive how the project is performing. It consists of the following key outcomes.

## Outcomes

* Burndown
* Test and Regression Rates
* Development Cadence
* Estimated Dates
* Cost and Duration

## How
Management reporting is normally delivered through a combination of reports, graphs, and charts.

Each of the outcomes and their required reports is shown below:

## Burndown
The burndown is a chart that shows how quickly you and your team are burning through user stories. It shows the total effort against the amount of work we deliver each iteration.

We can see the total effort on the left and our team's velocity on the right. This graph also gives us:
* Work done each Iteration
* Work remaining
* Work done so far
* When we can expect to be done

An example Burndown spreadsheet is available [here](http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/Sample-Burndown.xls)
