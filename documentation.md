# Documentation
Many items in a project need to be documented and documentation is key to a successful project. Documentation items are developed according to the phases of the project. They serve different purposes but together deliver the key public requirements of any software company.

## 1. Envisioning
Envisioning is defined as *the process of simplifying complex goals into a single statement or statements that can be learned and repeated by the entire team* - It's important to have a goal, and product teams are no different. People rise to lofty ideals and goals and the early stages of a project is where you envision what will be with your software and solution. Examples of good envisioning statements are:

> xxx product will help anyone move across borders by being a secure, verifiable COVID-19 Vaccine passport

> yyy product will help accountants save money and delight their clients by streamlining the creation, storage and retrieval of documents

Poor envisioning statements are overly large, wordy or difficult to get behind. In both the statements above, the products' vision statements include their benefit to people, and this is again the key to a good statement.


## 2. Architectural
While the parable of building a house on sand rings true in physical architecture, the same is true in software design. Every product needs a strong and robust architecture and set of guiding principles.

## 3. Developer
A Development team need to understand how to develop to this product, how you manage source control repros, how you perform and approve pull requests and how automated builds work. 

## 4. SDK
A Software Development Kit (SDK) should be developed to assist external developers use your software.
