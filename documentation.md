# Documentation

Documentation isn’t just a box-ticking exercise — it’s foundational to building, scaling, and supporting software that doesn’t fall apart under pressure. Good documentation brings clarity, reduces risk, accelerates onboarding, and improves long-term maintainability. This guide outlines the key types of documentation you should invest in at each stage of a software project.

---

## 1. Envisioning

Start with clarity. Envisioning is about boiling down ambition into simple, powerful statements that everyone on the team can rally around. These should be easy to remember, easy to repeat, and laser-focused on the end-user benefit.

Examples:

> "Enable seamless international travel through a secure, verifiable COVID-19 vaccine passport."  
> "Help accountants reduce costs and delight clients with smart document automation."

An effective vision is short, sharp, and motivating. If it doesn’t fit on a slide or get you excited, rewrite it.

## 2. Architecture

Your architecture sets the tone for everything else — get this wrong and you’ll be rebuilding in six months. Define the tech stack, design patterns, integration strategy, and architectural principles early. Focus on scalability, maintainability, performance, and security. Document:

- Technology choices and rationale  
- Core components and how they interact  
- Integration points and boundaries  
- Key design decisions and trade-offs

---

## 3. Developer Documentation

This is your dev team's bible. It should make it dead simple for internal and external developers to understand how things work, how to contribute, and how to stay aligned with standards.

Include:

- Coding conventions and code structure  
- Branching strategy and pull request process  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Deployment process and environments  
- Testing frameworks and coverage expectations

Good developer docs = faster onboarding + fewer stupid mistakes.

---

## 4. SDKs

If external devs are building on top of your product, a polished SDK is non-negotiable. This isn’t just some API reference dump — make it easy for others to succeed.

An effective SDK should have:

- Well-documented APIs with examples  
- Client libraries for common languages  
- Authentication and usage instructions  
- Sandbox/test environments  
- Sample apps and “hello world” demos

The goal is zero-friction adoption.

---

## 5. Implementation Documentation

Think like a sysadmin. This documentation covers everything needed to install, configure, run, and troubleshoot your software in a real-world environment.

Include:

- Installation guides (automated and manual)  
- Configuration options and templates  
- Environment variables and secrets handling  
- Common issues and how to fix them  
- Upgrade/downgrade instructions

Make it so clear that even a junior tech can follow it.

---

## 6. Platforms & Release Management

Track what you support, how you roll out changes, and what users can expect. Clear release documentation reduces support tickets and keeps customers happy.

Cover:

- Supported platforms (OS, browsers, hardware)  
- Versioning policy (e.g. SemVer)  
- Release notes (features, bug fixes, breaking changes)  
- Update/rollback instructions  
- EOL (end-of-life) policies

---

## 7. Documentation Quality Control

Docs go stale — fast. Set up a regular review cadence and assign ownership. Spelling mistakes and outdated steps kill trust.

Quality control includes:

- Peer reviews and style guides  
- Doc versioning and change tracking  
- Feedback loops from devs and users  
- Automated link and code snippet testing  
- Clear ownership for each section

---

## Final Word

Strong documentation makes everything easier — onboarding, scaling, debugging, selling, and supporting your product. Bake it into your process early. If your docs are an afterthought, so is your product.
