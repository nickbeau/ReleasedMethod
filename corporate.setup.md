# Corporate Setup

Getting your company structure right from the beginning avoids a mountain of legal, financial, and operational headaches later. This checklist assumes youâ€™re setting up a single legal entity (LLC or Pty Ltd) to trade and hold IP.

> ðŸ’¡ **Warning:** This isnâ€™t legal advice. Talk to an accountant and a lawyer. Shortcuts now will cost you down the track.

## Core Setup Checklist

* [ ] **Choose a Company Name**  
  Make it unique, available, and not embarrassing when said out loud.

* [ ] **Register the Company**  
  Use a professional service or your accountant to set it up properly â€” this isnâ€™t the time to DIY.

* [ ] **Apply for ABN / ACN (or local equivalent)**  
  Essential for operating legally and getting paid.

* [ ] **Register for Tax (GST, PAYG, etc.)**  
  Donâ€™t mess around here â€” get this sorted early.

* [ ] **Open a Business Bank Account**  
  Never mix personal and business funds. Ever.

* [ ] **Buy a Domain Name**  
  Lock in your .com / .com.au and any variations that matter.

* [ ] **Set Up Professional Email**  
  Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 â€” free Gmail is for amateurs.

* [ ] **Get Cloud Accounting Software**  
  Xero, QuickBooks or similar. Your accountant should have a preference â€” go with that.

* [ ] **Create a GitHub (or GitLab) Organisation**  
  Donâ€™t wait until your code is all over the place.

* [ ] **Set Up Core Cloud Accounts**  
  AWS, Azure, GCP â€” whatever youâ€™re building on. Do it under the company, not your personal email.

* [ ] **Create a Basic Website / Landing Page**  
  Doesn't have to be fancy â€” just a place to show youâ€™re real.

* [ ] **Decide on a Physical Office Setup (if any)**  
  Remote-first? Co-working? Hybrid? Figure it out and budget accordingly.

* [ ] **Create a Starter Sales Kit**  
  One-pager, pitch deck, intro email template, and pricing doc â€” keep it lean but sharp.

* [ ] **Write a Product Roadmap**  
  Doesnâ€™t need to be a novel â€” just know what youâ€™re building and why.

* [ ] **Start Building**  
  Code, mockups, MVP â€” whatever "build" means for you, get on with it.

* [ ] **Start Selling**  
  Donâ€™t wait for perfection. Get your thing in front of real customers ASAP.

## Extended Setup

These arenâ€™t "optional" â€” they just might not be day-one tasks.

* [ ] **Branding and Positioning**  
  Logo, colour palette, tone of voice â€” get consistent, not cute.

* [ ] **Marketing Strategy**  
  Who are you targeting? How are you reaching them? Whatâ€™s the message?

* [ ] **Business Insurance**  
  Public liability, professional indemnity, cyber â€” get a broker to help.

* [ ] **CRM System**  
  Even a simple HubSpot or Notion setup is better than spreadsheets.

* [ ] **Hire Foundational Team Members**  
  Donâ€™t hire too early. But when you do, make sure they're mission-fit.

* [ ] **Internal Policies and Procedures**  
  Keep it lightweight, but write down how things work as they scale.

* [ ] **Market Research and Validation**  
  Talk to real users. Validate before you overbuild.

* [ ] **Financial Model**  
  Build a forecast, set milestones, know your runway.

* [ ] **Partnerships and Alliances**  
  Look for leverage â€” donâ€™t try to do everything solo.

* [ ] **Scalability Planning**  
  Think ahead: people, tech, systems. Avoid rebuilds mid-growth.

* [ ] **IT Infrastructure and Security**  
  Use single sign-on, 2FA, password managers â€” basic hygiene.

* [ ] **Compliance and Legal**  
  IP agreements, NDAs, terms of service, privacy policy â€” no excuses here.

* [ ] **Learning and Development**  
  Build a culture of growth early. Itâ€™ll pay off.
